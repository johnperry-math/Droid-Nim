        On your turn, select a droid standing in the groups on the right.
        The leftmost droid will deactivate it and all droids between them.
        Then your opponent selects a position.
        Whoever takes the last of the droids on the right wins.
        You can find more information via the &#8220;Help&#8221; item in the menu (a question mark).
