        <item>Even though I was playing with &#8220;One arm behind my back&#8221;! I&#8217;m telling all my Droid friends about this!</item>
        <item>Yes! Yes! I won! Who&#8217;s The Droid? I&#8217;m The Droid! Yes!</item>
        <item>But of course: my brain is much smaller than yours. Who says bigger is always better? Not a Droid!</item>
        <item>As Descartes wrote, &#8220;I think, therefore I am.&#8221; I think several billion times a second. Whereas you&#8230; Uhm, are you sure you exist?</item>
        <item>Maybe you should lay off the video games and hit the books. I recommend &#8220;Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays&#8221;.</item>

        <item>Yeah, well, even a blind squirrel finds an acorn sometimes.</item>
        <item>Obviously you disassembled my bytecode and analyzed it to find the winning strategy. Not very sporting!</item>
        <item>I&#8217;m so embarrassed. How can I face my friends after losing to a human?</item>
        <item>You obviously spent too much time with &#8220;Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.&#8221; You won the game, but lost your social life, didn&#8217;t you?</item>

        Your opponent won! Now you&#8217;ve lost face. Maybe practice more?
