<h2><a name="idea">The idea</a> </h2>

Droid Nim is a game that challenges the mind while illustrating some advanced mathematical ideas.
It can be difficult to defeat the computer if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing,
and even if you do, one slip-up can cost you the game.
<p></p>
<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>

<h2><a name="gameplay">Gameplay</a></h2>

This section is divided into the following subsections:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#basic">Basic gameplay</a></li>
    <li><a href="#human">Playing a human</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="basic">Basic gameplay</a></h3>
There are two groups of droids: a column on the left,
and three or more rows on the right.
<center><img src="help_basic_game.png" width="50%"></center>
To play, choose any row, and any droid in the group on the right.
<center><img src="help_selected.png" width="50%"></center>
Lift your finger,
and the leftmost droid will deactivate all droids between them, including the one you selected.
<center><img src="help_played.png" width="50%"></center>

<p></p>

At this point, your opponent will do the same thing.
<center><img src="help_computer_plays.png" width="50%"></center>

<a name="winning"></a>There are two ways of playing the game.
<ul>
    <li>In <b>normal play</b>, the last player to deactivate a droid wins.</li>
    <li>In <b>mis&egrave;re play</b>, the last player to deactivate a droid loses.</li>
</ul>

Normal play is the default, but you can change to mis&egrave;re play using the Settings.
<p></p>
After a while, the droids get restless, and start to move about. Don&rsquo;t let that distract you!

<h3><a name="human">Playing a human</a></h3>
You can play a nearby human using Bluetooth!
To do so, touch the two-player icon in the toolbar.
<p align="center"></p>
The app will automatically enable Bluetooth if it is available on your device,
but you can only play a device with which you are already paired,
and the app will not pair two devices for you.
To pair devices, go into your device&rsquo;s Settings (<i>not</i> the app&rsquo;s Options),
select Bluetooth, and select a device you want to pair.
Both you and your opponent must pair your devices before you can play!
<p></p>
Once your devices are paired, you can decide whether to host or join a game.
One player will host the game, while the other player will join.
The player who joins has to play whatever game is on the host&rsquo;s device,
which puts him at a disadvantage; to counter that, the player who joins gets to go first.
<p></p>
When the game ends, the Bluetooth connection is disconnected, but Bluetooth is left on.
To play again, you need to touch the two-player icon again,
and decide whether to host or join. (You will not need to re-pair your devices.)
If you do not want to play again, you should probably turn off Bluetooth,
unless you&rsquo;re using it with other devices.
You can do that in your device&rsquo;s Settings (<i>not</i> the app&rsquo;s Options).
<p></p>
We strongly discourage you from adjusting <a href="#options">game options</a>
in the middle of a two-player game!
Depending on the changes you make, the game will restart, and communication will be lost.
This prevents someone from changing the criterion for winning mid-course.
<p></p>

<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>

<h2><a name="options">Options</a></h2>

If you select the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; (gear) icon in the toolbar,
several options will appear, along with some explanations.
Here&rsquo;s a little more detail on how some of them work.
<p></p>
<b>One arm behind my back</b> &mdash;
If a winning move is available, the computer will find it.
If you check this box, however, the computer will sometimes &mdash; <i>sometimes</i> &mdash;
&ldquo;make a mistake&rdquo; and choose a random square
even when it knows a different square would guarantee a win!
<p></p>
<b>Mis&egrave;re play</b> &mdash;
Ordinarily, the game decides winners and losers according to normal play.
If you check this box, the game decide winners and losers according to mis&egrave;re play.
(The difference between these two <a href="#winning">is explained above.</a>)
<i>Think before you do this</i> as it will start a new game!
<p></p>
<a href="#top">Back to the top</a>

<h2><a name="mathematics">Mathematical ideas behind the game</a></h2>

Droid Nim incorporates ideas from <b>number theory</b> and <b>combinatorial game theory</b>.
You can determine a &ldquo;value&rdquo; of a game by writing each row as a sum of powers of two,
and canceling any matching powers.
For instance, if
<ul>
    <li>row 1 has 6 droids,</li>
    <li>row 2 has 3 droids, and</li>
    <li>row 3 has 4 droids,</li>
</ul>
then as powers of 2,
<ul>
    <li>row 1 has 4 + 2 droids,</li>
    <li>row 2 has 2 + 1 droids, and</li>
    <li>row 3 has 4 droids.</li>
</ul>
After canceling matching powers, we see that the game&rsquo;s value is
<center>(<span class="strikeupdiag"><b>4</b></span> + <span class="strikedndiag"><i>2</i></span>) + (<span class="strikedndiag"><i>2</i></span> + 1) + (<span class="strikeupdiag"><b>4</b></span>) = 1 .</center>
For a winning strategy:
<ul>
    <li>In normal play you want the game&rsquo;s value to be 0 at the end of your turn.</li>
    <li>
        In mis&egrave;re you want to play the same way,
        <i>except</i> that you want to leave an odd number of rows with one element.
    </li>
</ul>
In the example above, then, we should remove 1 droid from row 2,
as all the powers will subsequently cancel.
<p></p>
As a courtesy, Droid Nim ordinarily shows you the game&rsquo;s current value.
You can use this to help determine your next move.
